An easy to use documentation system for the Wordpress Admin. Allows Admin level users to add and edit documentation pages. All other levels can browse and view documentation on the backend.

## Description

Creates a custom post type called "Admin Docs". Admin users have full access to create, edit, and delete doc pages. The interface for admins is the same as any Wordpress page. Admins can use child / parent page relationships to create related pages, which are easily browsable.

For users roles lower than admin, users can browse the documentation pages right from the Wordpress backend, but have no ability to create, edit, or delete doc pages

## Installation

1. Upload the 'basis-admin-docs' directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
